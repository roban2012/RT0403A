魔戒的“大一统”铭文（英德）<br><br> 	


Dark Lord Sauron Vs. Wizard Gandalf《魔戒》Dark Lord Sauron Vs. Wizard Gandalf 魔戒上的文字属腾格瓦古文字，在魔都（Mordor/Moskow）一带使用。魔戒上铭文在火焰中才能显现。<br><br>
<a href= "link08.html">中国国防弱了，世界就和平了？</a><br><br>
<a href= "link09.html">普京的克里米亚演讲</a><br><br>
<a href= "link06.html">Kissinger:  How the Ukraine crisis ends</a><br><br>

将魔戒上的铭文日耳曼神话腾格瓦文字直接翻译至英语和德语，如下： 英文：<br><br>

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br><br>

 One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br><br>

德文：<br><br>

Ein Ring, sie zu knechten, sie alle zu finden,<br><br>

Ins Dunkel (dark) zu treiben und ewig (eternal/永恒) zu binden<br><br>

这样对照才能比较准确地理解原文翻译。Lost in translation！英国一直害怕“公权力”，害怕“绝对真理”和“终极秩序”。<br><br>

欧洲大陆一直有“大一统”的传统，从罗马到拿破仑，从希特勒到斯大林。所以来自大论的“统一”企图都被视为对WAPS的征服和奴役。这不，卡迈隆（Cameron）在2013年又提议要公投“是否脱离欧盟”。而德国、俄国和法国一直努力促成欧洲（至少是西欧）的统一，不管付出何种代价。

What history can tell us about Russia, Crimea and Vladimir Putin<br><br>


    By Adam Taylor	<br><br>
    March 18, 2014<br><br>

On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an agreement that formally recognized the "reunification" of breakaway Ukrainian region of Crimea with Russia.
<br><br>
 "To understand the reason behind such a choice," Putin said in a speech to parliament, "It is enough to know the history of Crimea and what Russia and Crimea have always meant for each other."<br><br>

History. That was the central point of Putin's speech. And he wasn't just creating history by agreeing to accept Crimea C he was correcting history. Correcting the historical mistake from 1954 that saw Crimea end up as part of Ukraine.
<br><br>
Putin didn't stop there. He lashed out at the West about events such as the downfall of the Soviet Union, Kosovo, NATO expansion, Libya, Iraq and Syria. He argued that the Western historical narrative of these things was twisted; that U.S.-led military actions in places such as Kosovo and Libya had been illegitimate, and that America's reaction to Crimea's referendum was, at best, naive and hypocritical.虚伪<br><br>

Few Western observers failed to note the historical rhetoric that formed the core of Putin's argument. Fareed Zakeria called it "the most significant geopolitical problem since the Cold War," while Brookings scholar Steven Pifer argued that it was the "most blatant 喧闹 land grab in Europe since WWII."<br><br>

Putin believes he has learned history’s lessons. But has he?<br><br>
World War II<br><br>

One of the most common references in the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, Crimea  and Russia has been that of World War II and Nazi Germany. In his speech today, Putin invoked his favored tactic for criticizing the Kiev government, calling them "fascists, neo-Nazis and anti-Semites."<br><br>




It's true that the Euromaidan protests had an element of far-right nationalism to them, but the situation in Crimea, and Putin's justification for it, have also reminded others of Nazi Germany's actions before World War II C Hillary Clinton even went so far as to directly compare Russia's pledge of support for ethnic Russians based abroad to that made by Adolf Hitler for ethnic Germans as part of Nazi Germany's plans for "anschluss" and unification of all Germans under an "all-German Reich." Notably, when Austria was annexed by Germany, it held a referendum.<br><br>
Fall of the Soviet Union<br><br>

The fall of the Soviet Union has always been a bugbear for Putin: not so much because he loved Communism but because it seemed to mark the end of Russia's time as a great power at the center of an empire. Back in 2005, he even called it a "genuine tragedy."<br><br>

In today's speech, the Russian president returned to his anger over the end of the Soviet era, and in particular, how the situation in Crimea was handled. "Millions of people went to bed in one country and awoke in different ones," he said, "overnight becoming ethnic minorities in former Union republics, while the Russian nation became one of the biggest, if not the biggest ethnic group in the world to be divided by borders."<br><br>

The situation was especially significant in Crimea, he said, which became part of Ukraine in 1954 after a "personal initiative" from Communist Party head Nikita Khrushchev. "It was only when Crimea ended up as part of a different country that Russia realized that it was not simply robbed, it was plundered," he explained.<br><br>

Putin's theory on Crimea's place in Russian history makes some sense: The peninsula had been part of Russia from 1783 to 1954, and even under Ukrainian rule housed Russia's Black Sea Fleet. It's not always a pretty history, though. For example, the entire Crimean Tatar population was deported 驱逐 from Crimea during World War II, and a huge number are believed to have died. Putin touched on this in his speech, admitting that the Crimean Tatars were "treated unfairly" but adding that "millions of people of various ethnicities suffered during those repressions, and primarily Russians."<br><br>
54 percent of Crimean voters favored independence from Russia<br><br>
Putin also neglects to mention that Crimea's decision to remain part of Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union was decided by a referendum on independence in December 1991. That election found that 54 percent of Crimean voters favored independence from Russia C a majority, though the lowest one found in Ukraine.<br><br>

Cyprus<br><br>

Northern Cyprus is one interesting example that Putin actually neglected to mention. In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus and established control over the northeastern portion of the island, and in 1983, the Turkish north of the island declared independence from the Greek south, calling itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus." The U.N., however, did not recognize it, and to this day only Turkey does.<br><br>

Crimea and Cyprus are remarkably similar situations, David Klion at the New Republic argues:<br><br>




Turkey’s pretext for invading Cyprus was a coup, which is the term Putin uses to describe the overthrow of Ukraine’s corrupt but democratically elected president, Viktor Yanukovych. In this case, the coup was sponsored by Greece’s military junta with the aim of uniting Cyprus with Greece. This aim was unpopular among ethnic Turks, many of whom welcomed the Turkish invasion. Turkey faced near-universal condemnation for its actions, and has weathered regular U.N. resolutions criticizing the occupation ever since. While Cyprus never ended up joining Greece, both countries eventually found a home in the E.U., where membership has continually eluded Turkey.
<br><br>
Putin may have wished to avoid the comparison to Cyprus, it seems, as the end results were so unfavorable: a lack of recognition for Northern Cyprus, the rest of Cyprus moving toward Europe, and the diplomatic isolation of Turkey.
<br><br>











Perhaps more importantly, while Kosovo was a de facto independent state after NATO's  intervention, it didn't formally announce independence until 2008 (Kosovan Albanians had previously tried to in the early 1990s but it was only recognized by Albania). That's almost 10 years between conflict and independence, rather than the mere weeks we've seen in Crimea. Even then, a significant number of states and organizations, including Russia, China and even the United Nations, have not recognized Kosovo as a sovereign state.<br><br>

Putin does have an argument: The American justification that Kosovo was a "special case" seems exceptionally broad. But it's certainly not a "crystal-clear" situation.<br><br>

The future: Scotland and Catalonia加泰罗尼亚（西班牙东北部一地区）<br><br>

Scotland (now a part of the United Kingdom) and Catalonia (now a part of Spain) could well be independent sovereign states: Both are due to have referendums on independence later this year. While Putin didn't mention either today, Russia has used both to justify the Crimean referendum in the past. For example, Federation Council speaker Valentina Matviyenko recently said, "No one says the Scotland referendum is illegal."<br><br>

There are a whole range of reasons that Scotland and Catalonia are not much like the situation in Crimea. At its most basic, the referendums in Scotland and Catalonia are not taking place in an atmosphere of violence, the U.K. has agreed to recognize the Scottish results (though Spain will not not recognize Catalonia's), and the campaign period was longer than two weeks.<br><br>

Ultimately, Putin's appeal to history makes sense in two strands 线 of his political thought: the memories of a Russian empire that drive his plans for a Eurasian Union and his argument that the West's international dominance is decadent 堕落 and undeserved不恰当.<br><br>

Where he trips up, however, is in his belief that history can act for a justification in Crimea. History is often complicated and incoherent: Europe’s ever changing borders don’t necessarily justify yet another change.<br><br>
